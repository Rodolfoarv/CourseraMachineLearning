# Coursera Machine Learning

These applications were developed by Rodolfo Andrés Ramírez Valenzuela as self practices for the [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) MOOC
instructed by professor [Andrew NG](http://www.andrewng.org/).

The course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.

# Folder structure

The project is divided with different folders which shows assigments during the MOOC implemented in the programming language **Matlab**. Each week contains a different topic in Machine Learning which are:

  - **Week 1:** Linear Regression
  - **Week 2:** Multiple Linear Regression
  - **Week 3:** Logistic Regression
  - **Week 4:** Neural Networks
  - **Week 5:** Neural Networks
  - **Week 6:** Advice for applying Machine Learning
  - **Week 7:** Suppor Vector Machines

## Installing the application
    # Setup the project
    Clone the repository with the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/Rodolfoarv/CourseraMachineLearning.git

    # Run application
    All of the folders contain a "ex" file which functions as the main of our program.

Once the app has been loaded, you can access the functions within the program.
